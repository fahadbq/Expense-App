# Expense-Management
An expense management app is a software application designed to help individuals or businesses track, manage, and analyze their expenses. It provides a convenient and efficient way to monitor spending, organize financial records, and gain insights into one's financial situation. Here's a brief explanation of how an expense management app typically works:

Expense Tracking: The app allows users to enter and categorize their expenses. Users can manually input expense details such as date, amount, category, and description. Some apps may also offer features like receipt scanning, which uses optical character recognition (OCR) to extract information from receipts automatically.

Expense Categorization: Expenses are categorized into different categories or tags, such as transportation, meals, entertainment, or utilities. Categorization helps users understand their spending patterns and identify areas where they can make adjustments.

Budgeting: Many expense management apps allow users to set budget limits for different categories. The app can provide notifications or alerts when users exceed their budget limits, helping them stay on track with their financial goals.
